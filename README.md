# uavsar_wildfire_classification
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/797474411.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.11406530)

This product uses UAVSAR polarimetric data to generate **fire perimeter** and **burn severity** maps from HV polarization backscatter.

Before using this tool, apply radiometric terrain correction (RTC) to the UAVSAR data for study areas containing terrain shadow, using the [radiometric_terrain_correction](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/uavsar-wildfire-rtc) repository.

Ensure conda is set up prior to use. If not, mambaforge can be installed [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge), or conda can be installed [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

## **Alternatively** 
You can follow the steps within the README.md provided within `Docker_for_UAVSAR` folder to build an image that imports all of the necessary packages for the notebooks and opens a port for you to interact with through your browser.

## Setup (Mac)
1. Open terminal.
2. Clone this repository: 
    ```
    git clone git@github.jpl.nasa.gov:UAVSAR-Fire-Research/uavsar_wildfire_classification.git
    ```
3. Create a virtual environment using conda:
    ```
    conda create --name classification python=3.11
    ```
    Confirm with `y` to download the listed packages.
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```
    conda activate classification
    ```
5. Install requirements (this will take a while):
    ```
    conda env update -f environment.yml
    ```
6. Create a new Jupyter kernel:
    ```
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name classification
    ```
    Ensure the kernel is `classification` when using Jupyter Notebook.

This has not been tested for Windows OS, but the setup steps should be similar except running them on Anaconda Prompt. More information can be found [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file).

## Data Info
This product requires incidence angle images and the post-RTC HV images for the area of interest.

## File Descriptions

**Configuration Files**
- `config.json`: Configuration file for defining parameters and paths.

**Jupyter Notebooks**
- `crop_image.ipynb`: Crop the raster image by a fire perimeter in GeoJSON or shapefile format.
- `preprocessing_segmentation.ipynb`: Preprocess the images and perform superpixel segmentation. Outputs are saved for future use.
- `perimeter_generation.ipynb`: Generate the fire perimeter map.
- `burn_severity_generation.ipynb`: Generate the burn severity map (preprocessing happens here).

**Python Scripts**
- `process_utils.py`: Utility functions for merging GeoJSON (perimeter) or images (severity).
- `data_prep.py`: Prepare data for processing.
- `run_analysis.py`: Run the main analysis pipeline.

**Environment Setup**
- `environment.yml`: Conda environment configuration file.

## Workflow

### Fire Perimeter Map Generation
1. Use `crop_image.ipynb` to crop the raster image by the fire perimeter.
2. Run `preprocessing_segmentation.ipynb` to preprocess the cropped image and perform superpixel segmentation. The outputs for both are saved for the next step.
3. Execute `perimeter_generation.ipynb` to generate the fire perimeter map.

### Burn Severity Map Generation
1. Use `crop_image.ipynb` to crop the raster image by a fire perimeter in GeoJSON or shapefile.
2. Run `burn_severity_generation.ipynb` to generate the burn severity map (preprocessing will occur in this notebook).

**Notebooks Demonstrations**
- `crop_image.ipynb`
    - Crop raster image by user-defined coordinates, GeoJSON, and shapefile.
    - Reproject raster images to another coordinate reference system.
- `preprocessing_segmentation.ipynb`
    - Preprocess the images and perform superpixel segmentation.
    - Save outputs for future use.
- `perimeter_generation.ipynb`
    - Generate and select fire polygons with user interaction.
    - Merge output GeoJSON if a fire involves multiple flight lines.
- `burn_severity_generation.ipynb`
    - Generate the burn severity map.
    - Visualize the distribution of the log ratio values for each burn severity class through boxplot.

Each flight line should be processed separately, and outputs can be merged using `merge_geojson` (perimeter) or `merge_image` (severity) functions in `process_utils.py`.
